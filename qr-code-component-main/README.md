## My process
- Define root for all colors and default padding and boarder radius.
- Download the font and import them in `styles.css`.
- Download `normalize.css` to have default styles across all browsers.
- Start building the main structure using html.
- Start style diffrent part of the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- Share css classes , I used the class `corner` to define same corner for image and QR card.
- Share spacing, colors, and fonts.


```css
.corner {
  overflow:hidden;
  border-radius: var(--default-border-radius)
}
```
